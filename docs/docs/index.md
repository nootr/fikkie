# Fikkie

Welcome to the fikkie documentation!

Fikkie is a simple lightweight watchdog which monitors external services over
SSH.

Simply specify which commands should be run on which servers and what output is
expected, and fikkie will let you know when something's wrong.

For more information, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nootr/fikkie)
or the [PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/fikkie).
